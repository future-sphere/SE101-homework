        The United States Marine Corps (USMC), also referred to as the United
        States Marines, is a branch of the United States Armed Forces
        responsible for conducting expeditionary and amphibious operations[11]
        with the United States Navy as well as the Army and Air Force. The U.S.
        Marine Corps is one of the eight uniformed services of the United
        States. The Marine Corps has been a component of the U.S. Department of
        the Navy since 30 June 1834,[12] working closely with naval forces. The
        USMC operates installations on land and aboard sea-going amphibious
        warfare ships around the world. Additionally, several of the Marines'
        tactical aviation squadrons, primarily Marine Fighter Attack squadrons,
        are also embedded in Navy carrier air wings and operate from the
        aircraft carriers.[13] The history of the Marine Corps began when two
        battalions of Continental Marines were formed on 10 November 1775 in
        Philadelphia as a service branch of infantry troops capable of fighting
        both at sea and on shore.[14] In the Pacific theater of World War II the
        Corps took the lead in a massive campaign of amphibious warfare,
        advancing from island to island.[15][16][17] As of 2017, the USMC has
        around 186,000 active duty members and some 38,500 personnel in
        reserve.[2] It is the smallest U.S. military service within the DoD

        n World War II, the Marines performed a central role in the Pacific War,
        along with the U.S. Army. The battles of Guadalcanal, Bougainville,
        Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, Cape Gloucester, Saipan, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and
        Okinawa saw fierce fighting between Marines and the Imperial Japanese
        Army. Some 600,000 Americans served in the U.S. Marine Corps in World
        War II.[55] The Battle of Iwo Jima, which began on 19 February 1945, was
        arguably the most famous Marine engagement of the war. The Japanese had
        learned from their defeats in the Marianas Campaign and prepared many
        fortified positions on the island including pillboxes and network of
        tunnels. The Japanese put up fierce resistance, but American forces
        reached the summit of Mount Suribachi on 23 February. The mission was
        accomplished with high losses of 26,000 American casualties and 22,000
        Japanese.[56] The Marines played a comparatively minor role in the
        European theater. Nonetheless, they did continue to provide security
        detachments to U.S. embassies, and ships, contributed personnel to
        small, special ops teams dropped into Nazi-occupied Europe as part of
        Office of Strategic Services (OSS, precursor to the CIA) missions, and
        acted as staff planners, and trainers for U.S. Army amphibious
        operations, including the Normandy landings.[57][58]

        Marine Corps and are trained to respond appropriately and convincingly
